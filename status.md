Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have made the first iteration of a fully functional snake game including not hitting walls, collecting food, increasing the length of the snake as it collects more food, and displaying the score of the game. Our team has cited a source as inspiration for the basic snake game itself, however, the additional levels are unique and we anticipate including a menu to pick new levels.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Our team has not added additional levels yet but we are planning on doing that over break. Our plans for the next levels include doubling the food, increasing the size of the snake, creating an arcade level where we alter the food, and adding obstacles. We are also considering changing the speed of the snake to random during a given game and altering the speed to make the game more challenging. Our team is more concerned with making sure that we include multiple dynamic levels to the game first rather than adding parts such as the circuit. Additionally, we are still testing the circuit's functionality to see if we can include the force sensor portion of the project.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

There occasionally have been problems understanding the code that we are using as inspiration for our game, since there are certain functions and expressions that seem redundant until they are removed. Understanding the code has been the most difficult part so far, but we have a fairly strong grasp on it now and can proceed to edit it as needed.
