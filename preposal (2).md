# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Hologram game of tetris using something similar to this https://www.walmart.com/ip/3D-Video-Display-Projector-Miniature-Universal-For-Smart-Phone/498500330?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=101054287&&adid=22222222227443339026&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=522672071213&wl4=pla-1273613428996&wl5=9007300&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=310726302&wl11=online&wl12=498500330&veh=sem&gclid=CjwKCAjwzt6LBhBeEiwAbPGOgTloZ2jNVcaqWd7JZQ3qcFvZo44-V9PtzvMZc6TnLI2cc-rXxuI2-BoCacAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds Will use three dimensional code to program a tetris game. Group members have circuit materials from another class and would like to see what they can do with force sensors and accelerometers to modify the game

Raspberry pi laser game. Several lasers with sensors, if one is triggered, lets the player know with either a sound or connected to website/app that lets you know you tripped a wire 

Raspberry pi LED light controlled with voice project - could make some kind of picture out of the LED lights or something more creative than what the project is suggesting

Snake game but the direction changes with the force sensor

Ask for data from 1300 laundry rooms to make app that lets you know what washing machines and dryers are available on what floor

Connect scale to a program that converts grams to moles and allows you to input other reactants to see how much reactant you need to create a certain product. Might consider getting data from a database of some sort 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Would like to see how we could make this a phone app or if we could make it work on our computer?
Would need to look into circuits to make sure that the sensor is within normal limits.
