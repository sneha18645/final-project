# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Hologram game of tetris using something similar to this https://www.walmart.com/ip/3D-Video-Display-Projector-Miniature-Universal-For-Smart-Phone/498500330?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=101054287&&adid=22222222227443339026&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=522672071213&wl4=pla-1273613428996&wl5=9007300&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=310726302&wl11=online&wl12=498500330&veh=sem&gclid=CjwKCAjwzt6LBhBeEiwAbPGOgTloZ2jNVcaqWd7JZQ3qcFvZo44-V9PtzvMZc6TnLI2cc-rXxuI2-BoCacAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds
Will use three dimensional code to program a tetris game.
Group members have circuit materials from another class and would like to see what they can do with force sensors and accelerometers to modify the game

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Cynthia Zern

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Would like to see how we could make this a phone app or if we could make it work on our computer?
Would need to look into circuits to make sure that the sensor is within normal limits.
