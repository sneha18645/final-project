# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

3D Snake Game 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website where you can play the snake game through a force sensor, and if you want to you can switch to a “hologram” view where the game can be projected in 3D. We hope to make different levels of the game with different power-ups and other features.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our team plans to create a Snake Game using Pygame and then we will create the background of the game, the snake itself, then we will move the snake first using the keyboard and then, if all goes to plan, using a force sensor from a circuits class Cindy took last year. We will end the game when the snake hits the boundary of the background or itself. We will add food for the snake in random locations during the different levels and we will increase the length of the snake as it acquires more food. We want to make it increasingly challenging as well as entertaining for the player. Our team has also found a 3D prismatic projector made out of clear plastic that can effectively make our 2D snake on our website 3D. If time permits, we would like to incorporate a 3D version of our snake and potentially a 3D snake game. Overall, our group is confident that we will be able to make a snake game using Pygames and will be using a Raspberry Pi 3 and a force sensor and a prismatic projector if time permits to make our project more interesting.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Cindy Zern: tui90712@temple.edu
Sneha Gonipati: tuo18645@temple.edu
Both have Dr. Nichols as our TA nichols@temple.edu

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A snake game with a few new power ups, played on a keyboard first. We will incorporate at least three levels of the game with food and other incentives for the snake to acquire while not hitting itself or the boundaries of the background. We hope to create engaging levels to make our game more interesting and amusing to both our lab TA and the professor. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A snake game with new power ups where you can switch the controls to a force sensor. Cindy has a Raspberry Pi microcontroller as well as resistors, operational amplifiers, wires, and a force sensor that will function as circuitry to register tapping the sensor to change the direction of the snake. We are planning to have each tap move the snake ninety degrees to the left with four taps moving the snake in a counterclockwise square.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A snake game with new power ups, the option to switch to a force sensor, and the option to switch to a 3D view. The option to switch to a 3D view will be more difficult as it requires our output game to be created in three dimensions in order to render the correct image. This is something that neither teammate has accomplished yet but is willing to try before the end of the semester.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our first steps will be to install Pygames and make sure that we understand how it works and create our first basic level of the snake game. From there, we will add additional levels to make the game more interesting and include food and other power ups. This whole part so far will be only code and the snake will be controlled by the left and right keys in order to power the snake through the course. Next, we will build the circuit to control the force sensor. The Raspberry Pi controller will be able to connect to Python, however, our team is less familiar with this process and will need to do some research to figure out how to effectively connect the two devices. The next thing that will need to happen is the force sensing circuit will need to be created. Cindy has done this in the past but is concerned about the longevity of the sensor as it was used in a previous semester and has a backup sensor if anything does not work well. Cindy has made an equivalent circuit in the past using an Arduino Nano, however, that chip is being used for a different class project. Once this circuit is functional we will transfer the functionality of the arrow keys to the sensor and make a tap on the circuit equivalent to hitting the left arrow key. Lastly, if time permits we will modify our code to become three-dimensional so that our snake is more lifelike. We will be able to view our snake using a plastic prismatic cone and we hope that our game will be functional in that format. Overall, we know we can create a working version of the game, we think that adding the circuit is in reach before the end of the semester, and if all goes to plan we hope we can at least try making our game three-dimensional.
